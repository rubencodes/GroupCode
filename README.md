A minimalist, collaborative, real-time code editor with communications tools.

## About GroupCode
GroupCode was created in Summer 2015 as a project to help students collaborate on coding assignments. Through a simple, familiar interface of files, tabs, and workspaces, users can collaborate seamlessly on coding projects with Google Docs-like realtime capabilities.

## Technologies Used
GroupCode makes use of Meteor + Blaze, the Ace code editor, SimpleWebRTC for its video chat, and Streamy for websocket-based communication between clients.
